                <h2>The “Self-Confidence & Best-Self” Challenge:</h2>
                <p>Everyone expects - and needs - you to be <b>Self-Confident</b> and bring your <b>Best Self</b> to the
                    table, all the time, on all levels, as specialist, manager and leader. You are expected to up-
                    skill continuously, unlearn old habits and skills, then re-learn new ones, so that you can
                    perform with unmatching self-confidence.</p>
                <p>As you walk your career and life path upward, your organisation will expect you to remain
                    technically proficient in your field, understand ever changing computer and software
                    systems, be emotionally intelligent, spiritually mature, psychologically stable, outstanding
                    communicator, presenter of note, values driven and much more - all this reflecting your
                    levels of <b>Self-Confidence</b> and <b>Best-Self</b>. Welcome to the new reality in our <i>VUCA - volatile,
                    uncertain, complex, ambiguous</i> - world in overdrive and it is only going to intensify.</p>
                <p>Hence, you have hopefully realized you need to continuously develop yourself in order to
                    become and remain self-confident, through opportunities provided by your organisation - if
                    you are fortunate - or preferably on your own. Because of the amazing information age we
                    live in, you are able to read articles and books, listen to podcasts and watch videos, learn
                    from others’ examples, receive mentoring, do courses, diplomas, more degrees, attend
                    webcasts and engage other activities to sharpen the saw.</p>

                <h2>Important Questions to Consider</h2>
                <h3>How do you:</h3>
                <p>1. Demonstrate that you have engaged in all your continuous development
                    activities that are often readily available - almost prove that you have acquired
                    the necessary skills and knowledge for that next responsibility?</p>
                <p>2. How do you demonstrate that you have extracted relevant learnings, skills and
                    knowledge, especially practical application, from all your development activities?</p>
                <p>3. Even with formal certificates, diplomas and degrees that promise specific
                    outcomes, how do you show that you have captured, internalized and practiced
                    the relevant learnings from it? We all know that much of the content of these
                    programs arent practically relevant. How do you show that you have prioritized
                    the essentials, because you know what is and will be expected of you in that next
                    role?</p>
                <p>4. How do you navigate the transition from specialist to manager and formal leader,
                    then adapt your continuous development activities accordingly?</p>
                <p>5. How do you - in todays cost sensitive times - afford financially to continuously
                    develop, upskill yourself real-time (all the time, continuously), so that you can
                    match the real-time world?</p>

                    <h2>Solution = Me-Vision Academy</h2>
                    <p>Me-Vision Academy is a dynamic virtual platform that represents much more than an
                        ordinary academy. It will help you do all of the above and more, real-time, because we live
                        in a real-time world:</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="solution">
                <p>1. We help you build what we refer to as <b>Best-Self Confidence - not just self-
                    confidence</b> - from the beginning of your career as specialist all the way to junior
                    and senior leadership positions. Authentic confidence that stems from a healthy
                    <b>True Self</b>, a clear path towards the <b>Best-Self</b>, resulting in a healthy <b>Self Image =
                    Best-Self Confidence</b>.</p>
                <p>2. There are <b>six Best-Self Confidence Levels</b> inside the platform. Every year, as you
                    receive 3000+ Continuous Best-Self (CBS) Points you move up a level - growing in
                    the right kind of self-confidence. Its reachable, but enough of a stretch to ensure
                    continuous development and not a scramble at the end of the year, just to tick
                    the box - as we often see with the CPD process.</p>
                <p>3. Every year as you move from one level to the next, you are rewarded with a Me-Vision 
                    Academy Certificate, <b>declaring you “Best-Self Confident”</b> - professional,
                    competent, ready, in your chosen skillset and on your current positional level.</p>
                <p>4. We give you access to thousands of relevant <b>internationally recognized
                    certificates and diplomas</b>, free. You - or your organisation - just need to
                    purchase the actual digital or tangible certificate or diploma upon completion, at
                    a very reasonable price.</p>
                <p>5. Inside your Personal Development Plan, you electronically <b>capture any
                    development activities</b> inside your <b>Portfolio of Evidence (POE)</b> - you are
                    rewarded with Continuous Best-Self (CBS) Points for doing it, real-time
                    (immediately).</p>
                <p>6. You consciously capture your <b>relevant learnings</b> inside your POE - you are
                    rewarded with CBS Points, real-time.</p>
                <p>7. Based on your learnings you record goals, actions and commitments for <b>proof of
                    practical implementation</b> - more real-time CBS Points.</p>
                <p>8. You achieve your goals, actions and commitments - <b>succeed at the practical
                    implementation</b> - more real-time CBS Points.</p>
                <p>9. As you become your Best-Self more and more, you can <b>LEAD on a global forum</b>
                    with your knowledge, skills and expertise and can even be ranked on a
                    leaderboard in your particular sector - more real-time CBS Points for practically
                    leading.</p>
                <p>10. You are showcased on a <b>Best-Self Confident Leaderboard</b>, arranged by skillset
                    (sector), position and country. There are many advantages to being ranked on
                    this Global Leaderboard.</p>
                <p>11. Not only accountants, engineers and a few other selected sectors should belong
                    to organizations that declare them professional and competent, we all should.
                    Annually all those who achieve 3000+ CBS Points will appear on a different
                    Leaderboard, highlighting the Best-Self Confident individuals by sector, positional
                    levels and country.</p>
                <p>12. You will participate in activities that are a more surgical approach to your
                    trustable, accountable <b>Best-Self Confidence</b>, resulting in <b>emotional and spiritual
                    fitness</b> - more CBS Points and Me-Vision Academy Diplomas.</p>
                <p>13. When you need to share your POE - with all your activities, learnings and
                    practical implementations in it - we review it and extend a certificate, <b>endorsing
                    your Best-Self Confidence journey</b>, as an independent party.</p>
                <p>14. If you are a manager you can be given <b>real-time anonymous quantitative and
                    qualitative feedback</b> by anyone who works with and for you, on the universal
                    leadership levels of leading self, others, organisation and society. Participants
                    simply click on your picture on the leaderboard and follow the process. You
                    receive feedback and can customize your development around real-time
                    feedback, ensuring you develop relevant areas, today.</p>
                <p>15. As you progress into managerial levels, there is <b>Executive Club</b>, with focused
                    powerful personal and leadership development programs and certificates that
                    will help you lead from your Best Self. You will learn in detail how to lead your
                    self, others, organisation and society more consciously. Inside <b>Executive Club CBS

                    your certificates are sent real-time upon completion.</p>
