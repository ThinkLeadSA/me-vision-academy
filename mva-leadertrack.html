                <section id="why">
                    <h2>Why Track Leaders?</h2>
                    <p>No, it's not about clocking their office hours. It's about an ongoing, real-time understanding of 
                        their leadership prowess. However, LeaderTrack doesn't just aim to observe and understand, it aims 
                        to elevate. It's about tracking real-time how well your leaders steer their teams and 
                        responsibilities, all in synchronization with your handpicked leadership competencies and core 
                        values, then doing something about it...real-time. 
                        Isn’t that what happens with any top professional athlete out there? Aren’t they monitored, 
                        tracked all the time? Why should it be any different for Professional Leaders who determine our 
                        future and happiness?</p>
                </section>

                <section id="how">
                    <h2>How Does LeaderTrack Work?</h2>
                    <p>No cameras on foreheads, no invasive methods. Instead, we leverage the current cutting-edge 
                        technology. Much like tracking news stories in real time through eyewitnesses and smartphones, 
                        LeaderTrack taps into your leaders' greatest resource: their colleagues. Through laptops or mobile 
                        phones, every colleague can provide anonymous, real-time feedback. The result? A constant flow of 
                        insights, analysis and individualised development  that happen instantaneously. Leaders, 
                        organisations, coaches and leadership practitioners will actually know how Leaders are doing on 
                        the playing field of leadership, at any given moment.</p>
